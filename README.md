## Repo:

This repository is containing my work from the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) course [Front-end Web UI Frameworks Overview: Bootstrap](https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-frameworks) offered by [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.ust.hk/) as a part of [Full Stack Web Development Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack). Since the course is not free for making assignment submission, I am working on the assignments without submitting, and if you see something I am doing wrong regarding the descriptions, please inform me.

## conFusion:

**conFusion** is the main page the course is mainly focusing on in the assignments. In the first week we created *index.html* and in the assignment of the first week I extended *aboutus.html*. In the second week we created *contactus.html* and developed others using various **CSS/Bootstrap** designs. In the third week we improved *aboutus.html* and *index.html* using tabs, modals, and carousel. In the last week we learned about **npm**, **node**, **less**, **jquery** within **Bootstrap**, and **bower**, and as an assignment task, I have completed by scripting modals, but unfortunately, **bower** part has not been completed.

## Purpose:

The main purpose of the course itself and doing assignment for myself is to understand powerful *Front-end UI Framework* **Bootstrap** in depth.
